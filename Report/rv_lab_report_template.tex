Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of the kernel density method compared with the histogram method for estimation of a probability density from random samples:

\vspace{3in}




 Are your histogram results consistent with the multinomial distribution theory? 


{\em Text/maths answer  here}
\vspace{3in}


\item {\bf Functions of random variables}
For normally distributed ${\cal N}(x|0,1)$ random variables, take $y=f(x)=ax+b$. Calculate $p(y)$ using the Jacobian formula:


{\em Text/maths answer  here}
\vspace{3in}


Explain how this is linked to the general normal density with non-zero mean and non-unity variance:


{\em Text/maths answer  here}
\vspace{3in}



 Verify this formula by transforming a large collection of random samples $x^{(i)}$ to give $y^{(i)}=f(x^{(i)})$, histogramming the resulting $y$ samples, and overlaying a plot of your formula calculated using the Jacobian:


{\em Include your graphic here}
\vspace{3in}




Now take $p(x)={\cal N}(x|0,1)$ and $f(x)=x^2$. Calculate $p(y)$ using the Jacobian formula:

 Verify your result by histogramming of transformed random samples:
